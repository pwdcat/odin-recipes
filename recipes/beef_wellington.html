    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Beef Wellington, a culinary masterpiece, begins with a tender beef tenderloin seared to perfection and enveloped in a layer of tangy mustard, flavorful mushroom duxelles, and delicate prosciutto. Encased in buttery puff pastry, this savory parcel is baked to a golden, crispy finish, resulting in a symphony of textures and tastes: the succulent beef complemented by the earthy richness of the duxelles, all encased in flaky pastry. Served sliced, the dish reveals its layers and is often accompanied by a luscious sauce like red wine reduction or mushroom sauce, elevating its indulgent flavors to perfection.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2-pound beef tenderloin</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>8 ounces finely chopped mushrooms</li>
        <li>2 shallots, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>6-8 slices prosciutto or Parma ham</li>
        <li>1 pound puff pastry, thawed if frozen</li>
        <li>1 egg (for egg wash)</li>
        <li>Optional: Fresh thyme or rosemary for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Season the beef tenderloin generously with salt and pepper. Heat olive oil in a skillet over high heat and sear the beef on all sides until browned. Remove from heat and let it cool. Brush the cooled beef with Dijon mustard and set it aside.</li>
        <li>In the same skillet, melt butter and sauté the chopped mushrooms, shallots, and garlic until the moisture evaporates and the mixture thickens. Season with salt and pepper. Allow it to cool completely.</li>
        <li>On a clean surface, lay out a sheet of plastic wrap. Arrange the prosciutto or Parma ham slices on the plastic wrap, slightly overlapping, to create a layer big enough to wrap the beef.</li>
        <li>Spread the cooled mushroom mixture evenly over the ham layer. Place the mustard-brushed beef on top and carefully roll the ham and mushroom mixture around the beef, using the plastic wrap to help create a tight log. Chill in the refrigerator for 15-20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Roll out the puff pastry on a lightly floured surface to a size that will completely wrap the beef.</li>
        <li>Remove the beef from the refrigerator, unwrap it from the plastic, and place it in the center of the rolled-out pastry. Fold the pastry over the beef, trimming any excess if needed, and seal the edges, ensuring it's completely encased. Place seam-side down on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Optional: Make decorative cuts or patterns on the pastry and brush the entire surface with an egg wash (beaten egg).</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes or until the pastry turns golden brown and the internal temperature of the beef reaches your desired doneness (about 130°F (54°C) for medium-rare).</li>
        <li>Allow the Beef Wellington to rest for 10 minutes before slicing. Serve garnished with fresh herbs if desired, and enjoy your elegant and flavorful Beef Wellington!</li>
    </ol>
